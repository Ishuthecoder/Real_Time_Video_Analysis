This project implements a smart surveillance system using IoT and AI techniques. The system detects faces in real-time and provides detailed insights such as name recognition, gender, age, and emotion analysis, enhancing the efficiency of monitoring and security systems.


Features:-
Face Detection and Recognition: Identify individuals and associate them with stored names.
Attribute Estimation: Detect gender, estimate age, and recognize emotions in real-time.

Technologies Used:-
Software: Arduino IDE, Python (for data processing and AI models).
Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and other ML libraries.
Frameworks: IoT integration for real-time data communication.
